				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p> The assignment was to generate an image. I narrowed it down to a beach inspirte by Legend of </p>
			    <p> Wind Waker. Or I wanted to make an RPG map generator! This would make maps for RPGS like Final Fantasy or Legend of Zelda. I ended up </p>
				<p> choosing the map generator cause it was easier to imagine. 
					Note: Use WASD to move the camera to see more. It may just show a blank blue screen at first.

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p> I started in chatgpt, saying I wanted to make an island! I noted that I wanted</p>
				<p> randomly yellow beaches that sat on a blue ocean. On the beaches, I wanted to place smaller</p>
				<p> green shapes that would make up the thick foresty area of the islands
					while working on this, I realized that it would be far too hard to make a topological map like 
					Breath of the Wild, so I leaned towards a a more retro looking map, like something from
					Final Fantasy 1. This worked quite well. After a few failed attempts with random points connecting to make a shar
					and ugly island, I generated circle like objects that had a radius that varied as it generated. I
					used sound to get the right shape for the circles. I don't entirely understand how the
					sound-based generation works. After that, I recreated that shape, using the same radius pattern, but scaled the radius down so the green would not cover all of the 
					yellow. I then realized it would create much more intersting shapes if I merged islands together.
					I called these super islands. They would purposely spawn islands in groups. Then this created
					the issue of new island's beaches overwriting old island's green areas,  which didn't look great.
					So, I found a way to make all of the beaches, then go back and make all of the forests on top of the old beaches.
					This looked much better and gave them a very organic look. At the end, I added brown circles to represent mountains, to hit the basic geometry requirement.
					If I had more time, I would have worked on a more interesting way to add the mountains. 
					
					I almost forgot to note that I added camera movement along the way, to make it feel like you are exploring a little world.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was the first time, I've taken the back seat on coding and let ChatGPT do almost all of the coding for me 
					it was super interesting watching it complete a lot of that would have taken me several minutes in seconds. 
					It was pretty hard getting it on the same page as me in a couple of instances and I had a lot of trouble with it removing changes from previous 
					requests, making it hard to understand what was going wrong when the code did work. I often had to combine the code 
					it gave me and make one with all of my requests combined. Aside from that, I had trouble finding an image that was equally challenging and completable in
					the time constraints. I had trouble starting working on this project because I've been super passionate about 
					my current CMPM 170 project. But I managed to put the time aside and get this one done!
