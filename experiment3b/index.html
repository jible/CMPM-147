				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The point of this assignment is to make a dynamic tilemap by generates a matrix 
					of points of different types, then painting that matrix. First, programmed my drawGrid function, to see how the tiles looked.
					I wanted to have a bit more fun with this one since I had figured out how the tiles worked in my first itteration. I just wanted to see how the different tiles looked
					and I ended up adding a path tile to my drawgrid but never got around the generating it correctly, so I left that for another time. 
					I used this one to just find a bucnh of unique interactions. Im especially proud that the grass will go over the dirt patches and they go over the edges that go over the water.
					I'm also proud of the glittering water! I think it makes the scene much more interesting and alive! I'm not super happy with how it turned out because it feels
					like it doesn't work in some areas and it slows down after the first few cycles, but I have a good base for it.

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>
					First, I generate my matrix. I lay down grass on the whole matrix, just to fill out the background. Then, I use perlin noise to make mini-biomes with grassy, water, and dirt areas.
					It generates a height map and makes the areas that fall at a certain y value the water, then the lower area the dirt, then the lowest area was the grass. After that, I randomly place trees on grassy
					areas.  

					Next, I draw the sprites onto them by drawing whatever sprite I want to that coordinate in the matrix, multiplied by the size of the tiles.
					After placing certain types of tiles, I ask if it is an "edge tile", meaning that it is next to a tile of a different type. If it is, they should interact uniquely.
					The ends of rooms make walls! I do this by storing a code in binary which represents which sides are unique, compared to the current tile. Then, I use this 
					code as an index to an array to pick which tiles should be painted over the current tiles. For example, the top of a room is next to a background tile, so it stores 0001
					This is the index to my arrays, which tells my function that it should place the north wall tile over the current tile. Using this, I make it so the water areas are surrounded by ledges
					and the grassy areas leak into the surrounding areas and even leak over the ledges. I did this by placing the water sprite, then the ledge sprite, then the grassy edge sprite all on the same
					tile. 
					Lastly, I had a timer running for each water tile, set to update its own water tile if the timer hit a certain ammount of time. This makes all of the water tiles twlinkle in unique ways.
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This expriement was way harder than the previous 2! I had a lot of trouble understanding how the array and the drawcontext function worked. I wish I spent more time on the 
					terrain generation, but I honestly just left it to chatGPT. I pretty much told it what I wanted the area to look like and told it to use noise. I was super suprised that 
					it worked almost perfectly on the first try! I didn't even have to debug or play with the variables for my noise. I'm proud of how the tiles turned out, 
					but I'm annoyed that the assets limited it so some cases look weird. I ended up encountering a bug that I just didn't have the time to fix! The water tiles do not update correctly
					with draw context when they are on the border of the canvas. I walked through the code and couldn't find a reason for it to generated incorrectly!
