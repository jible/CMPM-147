					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>Hi! I'm James! I love to play video games like Pokemon and Stardew Valley! I'm pretty good at coding in C,C++, C#, and Python and I have experience with javascript.</p>

					<p> I also like to run and play volleyball and basketball! Right now, I'm working at Ike's as a sandwich artist, but I'd love to get a game design internship this Summer.
						I'm super excited for this class since I've tried working on some random generation in other coding projects and really enjoyed it! I can't wait to learn more about 
						random generation and makes some super cool stuff!
					</p>
