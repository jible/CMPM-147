                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>Infinity</p>
					<p>In this world, the tiles can create a path in any direction that extends infinitely. You can follow the path as far as you'd like! You'll definitely get bored before it runs out of path.
					</p>
					<p>	Variation in Space</p>
					<p>	As you follow the path, it will bend in new ways, making unique shapes and taking the player to new areas. Unfortunately, I was pinched for time on this one after all the time I spent on the other ones, so I did not manage to fill this world with decoration for the path to weave through.
					</p>
					<p>Variations in Key</p>
					<p>When the key is changed, the path resets, darting off in a new direction! Changing the key will take you on a new adventure every ime. 
					</p>	
					<p>Signs of Life</p>
					<p>The path is constantly unfolding in front of the player's eyes! It will move random distances in random directions as long as the world is running! The player will have to follow the path quickly or it will run off without them. </p> 
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I made a really simple function that plays every second and it walks in a random direction ( not the opposite of the previous direction). It travels in This
					direction for a random ammount of tiles and adds each of these tiles to the list of tiles that should be drawn
					as path blocks, rather than grass blocks. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This one turned out pretty basic. I wish I could have thrown in more details, but I was really pressed for time after the previous 2.
					So, I just settled with this. If I had more time, I would refine the path generator so it makes more interesting shapes and favors going away from the origin. I already have the idea for how to implement it!
					I also wish I just used sound to make some simple biomes or randomly sprinkled flowers or something around the path to make the path seem more interesting.
